Analysis:
The agent first replied in natural language summarising the document on algeria. 
Then, the agent, as requested, showed the full document including its metadata and pasted
in in the chat. This was done using the get_document_by_id function. The agent sourced the id itself
as described in the similarity search function. It then used the output of that function, to get the 
id and hence the full document.
